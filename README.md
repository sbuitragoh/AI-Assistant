This is a simple project which integrates an offline LLM model (qwen3) imported with OLlama, voice recognition and a tts (RealtimeTTS).

I used this project to practice offline LLM models and asyncio as an occurrence. 

to-do:

- Save all answer audios and put them together, maybe with folders
- Make it possible to write, speak either with a time limit, silence window or with key presses.
- Try to improve times for the thought process of the LLM.
